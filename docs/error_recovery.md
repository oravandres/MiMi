# Error Recovery Mechanism in MiMi

## Overview

The MiMi multi-agent AI system now includes robust error recovery capabilities that allow agents to detect, diagnose, and automatically recover from common errors. This document outlines the error recovery implementation, focusing on the specific issue of URL-as-file-path errors.

## Problem: URL-as-File-Path Errors

A common error in the system occurred when agents tried to treat URLs (especially those in the format `//hostname`) as file paths. This resulted in permission errors when trying to write to these paths:

```
[Errno 13] Permission denied: '//localhost:8080/_load_high_scores'
```

This typically happens when generated code includes URLs in the protocol-relative format (`//hostname` instead of `http://hostname`), and then attempts to use this path with file operations like `fs.writeFileSync()` in Node.js.

## Solution

The implemented solution has two key components:

1. **Preventive Measures**: System prompts now explicitly instruct agents to use full URLs with protocols.
2. **Error Detection and Recovery**: When errors occur, the system automatically detects URL-related issues and recovers by reformatting URLs and regenerating code.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Base Error Recovery in Agent Class

The core `Agent` class now includes a general error recovery mechanism:

```python
def execute(self, task_input: Any) -> Any:
    try:
        # Original execution logic
        # ...
    except Exception as e:
        # Attempt to recover from common errors
        recovered_result = self._attempt_error_recovery(e, task_input)
        if recovered_result is not None:
            # Log recovery and return recovered result
            # ...
            return recovered_result
        # Re-raise if recovery failed
        raise
```

### 2. URL Error Detection

The system detects URL-related errors using pattern matching:

```python
def _attempt_error_recovery(self, error: Exception, task_input: Any) -> Optional[Any]:
    error_str = str(error)
    
    # Check for URLs being treated as file paths
    if isinstance(error, PermissionError) and "//" in error_str:
        url_match = re.search(r"'(//[^']*)'", error_str)
        if url_match:
            bad_path = url_match.group(1)
            if bad_path.startswith("//"):
                fixed_url = "http:" + bad_path
                # Recovery logic continues...
```

### 3. SoftwareEngineerAgent Recovery

The `SoftwareEngineerAgent` includes specialized recovery logic that:

1. Detects URL-related permission errors
2. Fixes the URL format by adding the proper protocol prefix
3. Updates the system prompt to emphasize proper URL formatting
4. Regenerates implementation with the corrected guidance
5. Logs the recovery process and continues execution

```python
# Modified system prompt to emphasize URL format
fixed_system_prompt = system_prompt + f"""

CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED: In your previous attempt, you incorrectly used '{bad_path}' 
which was treated as a file path. Always use full URLs with protocol like '{fixed_url}'.
"""

# Regenerate implementation with fixed prompt
response = client.generate(prompt, system_prompt=fixed_system_prompt)
```

### 4. Project and Agent Logging

All recovery attempts are logged in both project and agent logs to provide traceability:

```python
# Log the recovery
recovery_details = {
    "original_error": str(e),
    "recovery_action": f"Fixed URL format from '{bad_path}' to '{fixed_url}'",
    # Additional details...
}

create_or_update_project_log(
    project_dir,
    "recovery",
    self.name,
    f"Recovered from URL format error in {self.specialty} implementation",
    recovery_details
)
```

## Testing

The error recovery mechanism has been tested with:

1. **Simulated errors**: Using mock implementations to simulate URL-related permission errors
2. **Automated recovery**: Verifying that the system correctly identifies and fixes the issue
3. **Recovery logging**: Ensuring proper logging of recovery attempts and results

The test scripts are available:
- `test_url_error_fix.py`: Simple demonstration of URL error detection and recovery
- `test_error_recovery.py`: More comprehensive test of the agent recovery mechanism

## Benefits

This error recovery mechanism provides several key benefits:

1. **Resilience**: The system can continue functioning even when agents make errors
2. **Self-Healing**: Agents can automatically correct common mistakes
3. **Learning**: The system emphasizes proper practices in subsequent generations
4. **Traceability**: The recovery process is fully logged for auditability
5. **User Experience**: Users see fewer catastrophic failures and more successful task completions

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements to the error recovery mechanism may include:

1. Additional error detection patterns for other common issues
2. More sophisticated recovery strategies for complex errors
3. Learning from recovery patterns to improve initial system prompts
4. User-configurable recovery options and strategies
