# MiMi Agent System - Bug Fixes

## Summary of Issues and Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to address several issues in the MiMi Agent System.

### 1. Agent Input/Output Format Issues

#### QA Engineer Agent

**Problem**: The QA Engineer agent was failing due to inability to properly handle different input formats from the integration process.

**Fix**: Updated the `execute` method to:
- Properly handle the case where the input is a complex dictionary
- Extract the correct integration content from various dictionary structures
- Gracefully handle the case where input is not a dictionary
- Improve error logging

#### Software Engineer Agent (Bug-Fixing)

**Problem**: The Software Engineer agent wasn't correctly processing test results from the QA Engineer, especially when nested in complex dictionary structures.

**Fix**: Enhanced the `execute` method to:
- Handle test_results that are strings or dictionaries
- Extract test results from nested dictionary structures
- Handle errors more gracefully with better error messages
- Improve logging of error details

#### Software Engineer Agent (Revisions)

**Problem**: The Software Engineer agent had issues when transitioning from "revisions" to "implement-revisions" tasks, with the error "Unrecognized input format for SoftwareEngineerAgent".

**Fix**: Enhanced the agent to handle more input formats:
- Improved the `execute` method to handle string inputs directly as revision plans
- Added support for various dictionary key names ("revisions", "revision_plan", etc.)
- Added detailed logging of input types and available keys for debugging
- Added fallback methods to check for revision documents in the project directory
- Enhanced the `_implement_revisions` method with better context gathering
- Added ability to use alternative directories if conventional directories don't exist
- Added special case handling for nested dictionaries containing revision data

### 2. Filename Generation Issues

**Problem**: Generated files had incorrect names, often with leading underscores or special patterns like "doctype_html.html".

**Fixes**:

1. Updated `extract_code_blocks`:
   - Strip leading underscores from filenames
   - Provide default filenames when empty
   - Replace "SEARCH" and "REPLACE" markers in filenames
   - Add special handling for HTML files with DOCTYPE

2. Fixed `sanitize_filename`:
   - Added special case for handling doctype_html pattern
   - Ensured index.html is preserved
   - Fixed issue where .html was being added to index_html
   - Added direct replacement of problematic patterns

3. Improved error handling in file saving:
   - Handle the case when target is a directory
   - Provide better fallback filenames
   - Clean up trailing periods in filenames

### 3. Error Recovery Enhancements

Added better error recovery for all agents:
- More detailed error logging
- Proper propagation of project metadata through error cases
- Better handling of edge cases

### 4. Testing

Added test cases to verify the fixes:
- Test for handling different filename patterns
- Test for QA Engineer with different input formats
- Test for Software Engineer bug-fixing with different test result formats
- Test for Software Engineer handling of different revision input formats

## How to Verify

Run the test scripts to verify the fixes:

```bash
# Test filename cleanup
python test_filename_cleanup.py

# Test the full agent pipeline
python -m mimi --config projects/sample/config --input "Let's engineer a flappy bird game in html and javascript"

# Test revision input format handling
python test_revision_format.py
```
